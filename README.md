# Chat Base

My entry to the [T3 Chat Cloneathong](https://cloneathon.t3.chat). This is more than just a clone, it's a full-stack application with a focus on self-hosting and being open to changing parts of the stack. The basis is the backend, which serves as a REST API for the frontend or mobile app. The frontend is a Next.js app, but it can be any other frontend framework.
